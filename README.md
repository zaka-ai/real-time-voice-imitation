### üìù Overview
This project features an intuitive interface that harnesses the power of two advanced models: the **RVC (Real-Time Voice Cloning)** model and the **Coqui TTS v2** model. By integrating these models, the system enables seamless voice imitation and high-quality text-to-speech capabilities. The interface also incorporates **W-Okada software**, enhancing performance and user experience. Notably, this system allows for **real-time inference**, making it ideal for applications that require immediate voice synthesis and cloning.

### üöÄ How to Run the Interface

1. **Download the [Hubert Model](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/hubert_base.pt).**

2. **To utilize RMVPE pitch extraction, download this [rmvpe.pt](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/rmvpe.pt).**
   
3. **Upload these files to your Google Drive**, ensuring you update the paths in the Colab.

4. **Upload your RVC models (.pth and .index files)** to your Google Drive, making sure to adjust the paths in Colab accordingly.

5. **Upload your Coqui TTS model files (.pth, vocab.json, config.json)** to your Google Drive, modifying the paths as needed.

6. **Run the Colab and launch the Gradio link.**
